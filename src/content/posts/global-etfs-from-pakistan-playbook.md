FIRE portfolios fail when all risk sits in one market, one currency, and one story. Global ETFs can reduce that concentration by spreading exposure across countries and sectors.

## Why global exposure matters

If your earning currency and spending currency are both linked to Pakistan, global assets can add a second engine to your long-term plan. This is not about predicting which country wins next year. It is about reducing single-country risk.

## A beginner allocation template

Use a two-bucket framework:
- Core: broad global equity ETFs.
- Stability: cash or short-duration fixed-income allocation.

You can then adjust percentages based on age, job stability, and drawdown tolerance.

## Rules that keep it simple

- Add monthly, not sporadically.
- Rebalance on schedule.
- Avoid thematic ETF hype unless it is less than 10% of your portfolio.

## Currency reality

Global investing introduces FX movement. That is expected. Evaluate performance over multi-year periods, not single quarters.
