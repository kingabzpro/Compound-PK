Many people overcomplicate FIRE math. You can get a strong first estimate with four numbers and then refine it over time.

## The 4 inputs

1. Annual living expenses today (PKR).
2. Inflation assumption.
3. Safe withdrawal assumption.
4. Expected long-run portfolio return.

From this, you can estimate:
- Target corpus.
- Required monthly investment.
- Approximate years to FI.

## A practical monthly workflow

- Update expenses.
- Re-check savings rate.
- Track current corpus vs target.
- Adjust contribution by a fixed amount.

This keeps planning dynamic and realistic, especially when prices shift.

## Mistakes to avoid

- Using one fixed inflation number forever.
- Assuming perfect returns every year.
- Ignoring taxes, fees, and cash drag.

Use calculators for direction, not false precision.
