Starting is harder than continuing. If you are new to investing in Pakistan, use this 90-day roadmap instead of trying to learn everything in one weekend.

## Days 1 to 30: Stabilize your base

- Track every rupee for one month.
- Build 3 months of core expenses in cash.
- Pay off high-interest consumer debt first.

Without this foundation, every market dip feels like an emergency.

## Days 31 to 60: Choose your lane

Pick one route to start:
- Broad equity exposure through regulated mutual funds.
- A focused set of PSX companies only if you can study statements and stay disciplined.

The biggest beginner error is opening too many positions too early.

## Days 61 to 90: Systemize

- Invest on the same date each month.
- Use a fixed allocation split (example: equity, cash, fixed income).
- Review once a month, not every hour.

If your system works in boring months, it will save you in volatile months.

## Common traps

- Chasing tips from social media groups.
- Buying what already doubled.
- Selling quality assets to fund impulse purchases.
