Most early losses are not caused by bad luck. They come from repeatable mistakes. Here are the seven patterns that hurt beginners most.

## 1) No emergency buffer
Without cash reserves, even small life events force bad selling decisions.

## 2) Investing borrowed money
Leverage magnifies mistakes before your process is stable.

## 3) Following random tips
If you do not understand the business, you do not understand the risk.

## 4) Overtrading

Frequent buying and selling raises costs and increases emotional errors.

## 5) No position sizing rules

One oversized bet can set you back years.

## 6) Ignoring diversification

Single-sector concentration may look smart in bull runs and painful later.

## 7) Quitting after one bad quarter

Compounding requires time. Most people stop right before long-term benefits begin.

## A better beginner checklist

1. Hold emergency cash.
2. Invest monthly.
3. Diversify.
4. Review decisions quarterly.
5. Keep learning from regulated educational sources.
