This is a simplified educational case study, not personal financial advice.

A Karachi-based couple in their early 30s wanted optional work by their mid-40s. They started with inconsistent savings and no clear allocation policy.

## Starting point

- Household net income: moderate but stable.
- Savings rate: below 15%.
- Investing behavior: ad hoc, event-driven.

## What changed in year 1

1. Savings moved to salary day automation.
2. Portfolio policy was documented on one page.
3. Monthly investment amount increased each quarter.
4. Lifestyle inflation was capped after bonuses.

## Allocation framework

- Growth bucket: diversified equity exposure.
- Stability bucket: emergency cash and fixed-income instruments.
- Skill bucket: courses and certifications to increase future income.

## Outcome after sustained execution

Within a few years, they crossed PKR 5 million in invested assets, mostly through consistency rather than aggressive stock picking. Their bigger win was behavioral: no panic selling, no hot-tip chasing, and no long investing gaps.

## What this case teaches

- Systems beat motivation.
- A clear allocation policy prevents emotional decisions.
- Rising income should feed investments, not only lifestyle upgrades.
