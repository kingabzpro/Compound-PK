Most people focus on returns and ignore the input side of the equation. But your monthly investable surplus can grow much faster than portfolio returns if you improve savings and income together.

## Part 1: Lift savings without feeling punished

Try this sequence:
1. Remove one major recurring expense.
2. Cap lifestyle upgrades for 12 months.
3. Auto-transfer savings before discretionary spending.

The goal is not extreme frugality. The goal is a stable monthly surplus that keeps flowing to investments.

## Part 2: Grow earning power deliberately

Build a 2-year skill plan:
- One high-value technical skill.
- One communication or sales skill.
- One monetizable side project.

Your first goal is not replacing your salary. It is adding predictable extra cash flow that goes directly into long-term assets.

## Part 3: Protect the engine

- Keep emergency cash separate.
- Avoid debt for status purchases.
- Increase investments whenever income rises.

Income growth plus savings discipline is a compounding loop. Once it starts, FIRE timelines shrink faster than expected.
