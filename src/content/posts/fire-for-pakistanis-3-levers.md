Most people think FIRE is about finding one perfect stock. It is not. In Pakistan, FIRE is usually built by mastering three boring but powerful levers over 10 to 20 years.

## 1) Savings rate beats market timing

If your savings rate rises from 10% to 30%, your financial trajectory changes immediately. The market may go up or down this year, but your cash flow discipline is under your control today.

A practical target for beginners:
- Start at 20%.
- Add 1% every month until you reach 30%.
- Route it automatically on salary day.

## 2) Time in the market compounds silently

Compounding is slow in year 1 and obvious by year 10. That is why consistency matters more than intensity. Monthly investing, even in modest amounts, can outperform random lump-sum behavior driven by fear.

## 3) Behavior decides outcomes

Most portfolios fail because people panic, pause investing, and restart late. Set a simple rule:
- Invest every month.
- Rebalance once or twice a year.
- Do not react to headlines unless your life situation changes.

## Your 30-day reset

1. Calculate current savings rate.
2. Build or top up a cash emergency buffer.
3. Turn on automated monthly investing.
4. Define your "do nothing" rule during volatility.

FIRE is not an event. It is a repeatable process.
